Notes from skype call 01.08.19
- mostly signal processing etc.
- joint venture @ St. Thomas's Hospital (Waterloo)
- ML: segmentation projects, reconstruction, image classification
- lower res data from hospital scanners; trying to do transfer learning applied to limited dataset (7 Tesla datasets)
- knee cartilage deep learning MRI: medical students --> acquiring and getting gold standard data
- getting rid of image artifacts from 7 Tesla images
- MRI: sampling radio frequency signal giving points from Fourier domain of the image 
(k-space) --> to get resolution target, the Nyquist criteria is limiting; people are trying to get 
around this, (compressed sensing, exploiting prior info)
- applying ML to inverse problems of image processing
- possible objectives: MR physics and pulse sequence development, data acquisition, truth data & data cleaning
- he's got a faster gpu coming 
- His students: 
   - Michael Mendoza <m.mendoza711@gmail.com>: joining this year from USA
   - Akshay Chaudhari did work on low-res super-resolution data
   - has an MSc student working on the transfer learning 
- 7 Tesla segmentations done by a commercial partner --> might put strain on open-sourcing code 
- writing a paper? parts could be published; co-authorship possible... submitting and getting published can take 
a long time >1 yr
