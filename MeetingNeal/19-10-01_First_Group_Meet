01.10.19: First Group Meeting
General
- Project: cartilage and knee segmentation analysis 
- He doesn't 'do' email; watsapp instead
- Fimrib software library for brain scans
- Oxford brain segmentation program, can set a reference brain
- Joint segmentation not as advanced as brain - muscle volumes, cartilage vol / thickness, meniscus etc.
- Ostearthritis Initiative program in US
- Brain scans fairly homogenous; knees and joimts more varied between individuals
- Neal has exclusive knee segmentation data 
- U-net and other canned neural net architectures already available for segmenting 
- Data: 5000 scans 'gold standard' hand-labelled knee segments
- MRI scanners: 1-3 Tesla strength MRI scanners typical - Neal's group collecting high res 7T knee data; 
will also get those (currently 30) high res samples segmented
- Medical Images: DICOM standard format for medical images, also 3dslicer
- Connect to web based, python platform that Neal's MSc student wrote (as UI)
- Two GPUs available to us: ?dual gpu machine 11gb gd4 rt80 nvidia? 2tb 10tb seagate baracuda
- Nyquist: twice the highest frequency, determines how much data needs to be sampled
- Overview of MRI: sampling radio frequency signals in FT domain; critically sampling k-space, inverse 3d FT to get the image
- Exploit prior knowledge data to speed up MRI and sample fewer points
- Reinforcement learning bayesian alpha 
- Workspaces: Lab downstairs, Neal's office

Division of Labor 
- integration with the platform (python)
- transfer learning 
- GAN based data augmentation
- run study to get 50-100 new datasets  -- ca. 25 hrs MRI time
- MRI acquisition: 
    - Exploit prior knowledge data to speed up MRI and undersampling data
- GPUs running
